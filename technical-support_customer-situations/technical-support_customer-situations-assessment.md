## Technical Support: Customer Situations

#### Q1. A customer calls, complaining their laptop won't start. What should you say?

- [ ] "That must be frustrating. What have you tried so far?"
- [ ] "Not a problem! I can fix this for you in no time."
- [ ] "I'm sorry. You may need to replace your battery."

#### Q2. A customer calls in becaue her wireless speaker keeps dropping audio. She can't determine the cause of the issue. What should you say?

- [ ] "I get this problem all the time. It's probably a broken soundcard."
- [ ] "That must be frustrating. Did you drop the speaker?"
- [ ] "I'm sorry about that. Check your systray and tell me if your Bluetooth is enabled."
- [ ] "I'm sorry to hear that. When did this start happening?"
- [ ] "Can you bring your computer and speaker into a store? We can troubleshoot better there."

#### Q3. A customer calls asking for help.

```
CUSTOMER: My computer has been running slow for a few days. I'm sure it's a virus
```

- [ ] "This might be just a software bug. Can you reboot your computer in safe mode?"
- [ ] "Can you open up your task manager and see which processes are using high CPU?"
- [ ] "This comes up often, and it's usually not a virus. What else do you think it might be?"
- [ ] "That might be the case. Would you mind running a virus scan?"
- [ ] "Let's see if we can rule that out. Can you tell me more about what you mean by running slow?"

#### Q4. A customer calls asking for help.

```
CUSTOMER: I can't log in to my account! I've been trying for the past hour and the same error message pops up! I need to submit this before 5 PM so I don't get charged any late fees.
```

- [ ] "Do you usually get errors when you try to pay? Some people just have bad luck."
- [ ] "Setting up automatic payments helps prevent this problem. You might want to consider that for the future."
- [ ] "I'm sorry our system is making it hard for you to manager your account. What error message are you seeing?"
- [ ] "Waiting until the last minute makes errors much more stressful. I' sure we can fix this for you."
- [ ] "What error are you getting? That will help me determine if the problem is actually with the system."

#### Q5. A customer receives a password reset notice and is unsure if it is a legitimate request.

```
CUSTOMER: I'm calling because I got an email telling me I need to reset my password. I don't know why you're constantly making me change my password. Did this email actually come from yo, or is it one of those scams?
```

What should you say?

- [ ] "If what you received came from our email address, then it's definitely from us and you should follow what it say."
- [ ] "I worry when I get messages like that, too. Let's review your account and see if we emailed you."
- [ ] "You got that email because your password was compromised. You should update it now."
- [ ] "I'm sorry you're getting so many requests, but they're routine reminders. It's nothing to worry about."
- [ ] "Changing passwords regularly can be a pain, but it's your best protection against scams."

#### Q6.

```
CUSTOMER: I hope you can help me. I'm trying to use the email software that came with my computer, but I can't seem to figure it out.
SUPPORT AGENT: No worries, I'm here to help. When did you get your computer?
CUSTOMER: I've had it less than a month. Every time I try to set my email up, it just seems complicated.
```

What should the agent say next?

- [ ] "I can definitely help. In the future, let us know about any issue right away to avoid causing damage."
- [ ] "This seems straightforward, so I can probably resolve it quickly. Let me configure the app for you."
- [ ] "Are you using the correct credentials? Normally these issues happen when you use the incorrect password."
- [ ] "This app is fairly simple to use. Let's set up a remote screen sharing session."
- [ ] "Sometimes these apps can be complicated to set up. Would you like me to guide you through setup?"

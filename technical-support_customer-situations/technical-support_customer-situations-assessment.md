## Technical Support: Customer Situations

#### Q1. A customer calls, complaining their laptop won't start. What should you say?

- [ ] "That must be frustrating. What have you tried so far?"
- [ ] "Not a problem! I can fix this for you in no time."
- [ ] "I'm sorry. You may need to replace your battery."

#### Q2. A customer calls in becaue her wireless speaker keeps dropping audio. She can't determine the cause of the issue. What should you say?

- [ ] "I get this problem all the time. It's probably a broken soundcard."
- [ ] "That must be frustrating. Did you drop the speaker?"
- [ ] "I'm sorry about that. Check your systray and tell me if your Bluetooth is enabled."
- [ ] "I'm sorry to hear that. When did this start happening?"
- [ ] "Can you bring your computer and speaker into a store? We can troubleshoot better there."

#### Q3. A customer calls asking for help.

```
CUSTOMER: My computer has been running slow for a few days. I'm sure it's a virus
```

- [ ] "This might be just a software bug. Can you reboot your computer in safe mode?"
- [ ] "Can you open up your task manager and see which processes are using high CPU?"
- [ ] "This comes up often, and it's usually not a virus. What else do you think it might be?"
- [ ] "That might be the case. Would you mind running a virus scan?"
- [ ] "Let's see if we can rule that out. Can you tell me more about what you mean by running slow?"

#### Q4. A customer calls asking for help.

```
CUSTOMER: I can't log in to my account! I've been trying for the past hour and the same error message pops up! I need to submit this before 5 PM so I don't get charged any late fees.
```

- [ ] "Do you usually get errors when you try to pay? Some people just have bad luck."
- [ ] "Setting up automatic payments helps prevent this problem. You might want to consider that for the future."
- [ ] "I'm sorry our system is making it hard for you to manager your account. What error message are you seeing?"
- [ ] "Waiting until the last minute makes errors much more stressful. I' sure we can fix this for you."
- [ ] "What error are you getting? That will help me determine if the problem is actually with the system."

#### Q5. A customer receives a password reset notice and is unsure if it is a legitimate request.

```
CUSTOMER: I'm calling because I got an email telling me I need to reset my password. I don't know why you're constantly making me change my password. Did this email actually come from yo, or is it one of those scams?
```

What should you say?

- [ ] "If what you received came from our email address, then it's definitely from us and you should follow what it say."
- [ ] "I worry when I get messages like that, too. Let's review your account and see if we emailed you."
- [ ] "You got that email because your password was compromised. You should update it now."
- [ ] "I'm sorry you're getting so many requests, but they're routine reminders. It's nothing to worry about."
- [ ] "Changing passwords regularly can be a pain, but it's your best protection against scams."

#### Q6.

```
CUSTOMER: I hope you can help me. I'm trying to use the email software that came with my computer, but I can't seem to figure it out.
SUPPORT AGENT: No worries, I'm here to help. When did you get your computer?
CUSTOMER: I've had it less than a month. Every time I try to set my email up, it just seems complicated.
```

What should the agent say next?

- [ ] "I can definitely help. In the future, let us know about any issue right away to avoid causing damage."
- [ ] "This seems straightforward, so I can probably resolve it quickly. Let me configure the app for you."
- [ ] "Are you using the correct credentials? Normally these issues happen when you use the incorrect password."
- [ ] "This app is fairly simple to use. Let's set up a remote screen sharing session."
- [ ] "Sometimes these apps can be complicated to set up. Would you like me to guide you through setup?"

#### Q7. A customer calls with a website problems.

```
CUSTOMER: My website isn't working! The "Shop Our Products" page is down, and some weird text I don't understand is there instead. Why do things like this always happen to me?
```

What should you say?

- [ ] "I'm sorry you're having a server issue. Restart it, and that should take care of your problem."
- [ ] "Maybe a setting got changed by accident? Did you clear your cookies recently?"
- [ ] "I'm sorry to hear that. Would you read me the text that's currently on the page."
- [ ] "This must be frustrating, but your website developer would be the one to help you with this type of issue."
- [ ] "Don't worry. If you send me a copy of the server error log. I can have this fixed quickly."

#### Q8. An employee walks up to the IT help desk with a cracked screen on her smartphone.

```
EMPLOYEE: I dropped my phone this morning and I can't access my apps. I need my two-factor authentication app to work today, but I can't get my phone fixed until this weekend. What should I do?
```

What should you say?

- [ ] "Did you set up your office phone as a backup? Then we'll have no problem getting you authenticated."
- [ ] "You should look into a protection case to avoid getting stuck like this. Have you tried working with the broken screen?"
- [ ] "Well, now you have a reason for a new phone! Let's see if you are eligible for a company replacement."
- [ ] "Two-factor authentication is as annoying as a broken screen. Have you tried bypassing it?"
- [ ] "Oh no, I hate when my phone breaks! Let's see what workarounds we can find until you can fix it."

#### Q9.

```
CUSTOMER: I don't know what to do! Every time I turn on my computer, a blue screen tells me to restart it. Every time I restart it, the same screen appears again!
```

What should you say?

- [ ] "Oh, no! You have the Blue Screen of Death. Several things may cause this, so let's eliminate each potential cause."
- [ ] "This must be frustrating. There can be many reasons for the blue screen. Let's try a few things and see if we can find a cause."
- [ ] "I'm sorry this is causing a problem for you. Let me transfer you to next-level support. They deal with this problem frequently."
- [ ] "That sounds pretty serious. I recommend bringing it into the store for repair."
- [ ] "This happens sometimes when you've installed new software. You'll need to uninstall any recently added programs."

#### Q10.

```
EMPLOYEE: I'm trying to get our new printer connected to the company network. I'm following what it says to do in settings, but when I test a page, nothing happens.
SUPPORT AGENT: OK! Let's find the problem, I'll need to know the printer's MAC address.
EMPLOYEE: My printer's what? I have no idea what you're talking about.
```

What should the agent say next?

- [ ] "The test page will have the MAC address and other information I'll need to get you set up."
- [ ] "I'm sorry. How about I give you a step-by-step guide what will navigate you to what's needed?"
- [ ] "I apologize. Let me walk you through where to find it and what else I'll need to help you."
- [ ] "My mistake. If you do a quick web search of MAC, it's point you to what I need."
- [ ] "Let me explain. A MAC address is like the name of the hardware you can use to look the printer up."

#### Q11. A customer is having problems accessing his security cameras from his phone.

```
CUSTOMER: I don't know what happened. The app was working fine yesterday, I travel often and need to check in on my house. I'm flying out tommorrow and need this to work.
```

What should you say?

- [ ] "No wonder you're upset. Are the cameras still under warranty? Replacing them would be a quick fix."
- [ ] "I hate when my devices don't work. I promise we can get this working for you right away."
- [ ] "I'm sorry this isn't working for you. It's likely just a missing driver. Downloading the app again will address it."
- [ ] "I'm sure we can get this resolved. Can you describe the video quality?"
- [ ] "Your security is important to you, so let's get them back up for you. Can you access the feed from a desktop."

#### Q12.

```
OFFICE MANAGER: All our employees use this editing software, and it isn't working for anyone.
SUPPORT AGENT: I'm really sorry to hear that. When did you first notice this?
OFFICE MANAGER: A few minutes after we opened. Someone said maybe the software server might be down.
```

- [ ] "Server issues are the worst! I'll restart it for you. That takes care of most problems."
- [ ] "Thanks for helping me try to identify the cause. May I ask you a few questions first to confirm this?"
- [ ] "It's likely a high traffic volume issue. Give it another hour and you should be able to get back on."
- [ ] "I'm sorry this is keeping you and your team from being able to work. I guarantee to have this resolved immediately."
- [ ] "I'm sorry you're experiencing this. Would you mind if I hand this over to my coworker, who has worked on this before?"

#### Q13. A customer calls a support agent about an internet service issue.

```
CUSTOMER: I just don't know what happened. I logged onto my computer so I could look up some recipes and I can't get to them.
SUPPORT AGENT: I'm sorry you're having this issue. Can you locate your router for me?
CUSTOMER: That thingy with the blinking lights my daughter set up for me? It looks the same as it always does. How do I get it back to my recipes?
```

What should the agent say next?

- [ ] "This must be so frustrating for you. Could you have your daughter call me to fix the issue?"
- [ ] "I'll do what I can to help you find your recipes. Are you sure it's the internet that isn't working?"
- [ ] "I'll do my best to help you get back to your recipes. Have you tried visiting any other webpages?"
- [ ] "This should be a simple fix. Is the wi-fi icon on the bottom of your screen?"
- [ ] "I'm sorry you can't get to your recipes. Did you change any settings that you didn't know what they do?"

#### Q14. A sales employee approaches a support agent at the IT help desk.

```
EMPLOYEE: Help! I lost all the emails on my phone! I have a meeting soon. Can you fix this quickly?
SUPPORT AGENT: I know this is really stressful. How much time do you have to work with me?
EMPLOYEE: I have 15 minutes. I need some of these emails for that meeting.
```

- [ ] "Oh, I've seen this many times. I'm sure they're just hidden and not lost."
- [ ] "I think we can get to the bottom of it. Have you run a diagnostic on your phone? It'll take about an hour."
- [ ] "I'm sorry you're experiencing this. That's why I use our company messaging app now."
- [ ] "Let's get started, but we may need to set up time afterwards. Can I ask you a few questions first?"
- [ ] "Phone issues are quick for me to solve. I can probably have this fixed in 10 minutes."

#### Q15. While conducting routine maintenance, you discover a network server that needs to be replaced fairly soon. The server must be shut down during the replacement, which will affect office operations. The office manager asks for an update. What should you say.

- [ ] "I did notice a server that look like it will need attention soon. We have some time before we need to replace it, though."
- [ ] "Everything looked fine, but I found one server we need to replace. Can we find a time to schedule a replacement when it will affect the fewest people?"
- [ ] "Luckily, only one server needs to be replaced. I'll send an email letting everyone know when to expect a service outage."
- [ ] "I'm sorry to report there's a server we'll need to replace. I can replace it now if you want to let the office know server will be down for a bit."
- [ ] "I found one server that needs to be replace immediately! We should do it now, but I promise service will only be down for just a moment."

#### Q16.

```
CUSTOMER [frustrated]: My phone stopped getting emails.
SUPPORT AGENT: I see you're using the built-in mail app. I really recommend downloading and installing a specialized app. Let me download it for you and set you up.
CUSTOMER [near tear]: I don't want any apps! I don't know anything about apps! I just want to work like it used to!
```

- [ ] "I'm sorry this is frustrating you. Can you still send emails? The incoming and outgoing servers are different, so one may still work."
- [ ] "Ok - Your phone needs to work for you. Let's take a look together and see why you stopped receiving email."
- [ ] "Let's go over a few things that will help us troubleshoot. Can you get to webmail?"
- [ ] "An app is any program that runs on your phone, like your email. A better app might be a good fit."
- [ ] "We can get things working even better than before. Let's try out this new app and see if you like it."
